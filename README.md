# Book-to-Anki ðŸ“š

### What is it?
Converts various book files to Anki decks. At the moment it only reads the text and saves it to cards. You could improve this by adding TTS, but I didn't want to have so many files in my Anki.

### How does it work?
It's just a small command-line program. You input the file, name of the output deck and the delimiter type. The delimiter defaults to the Japanese period if nothing is inputted.
The card type at the moment must be titled "Default" and needs "Front" and "Back" fields. If you'd like to change this, please look at the "lib/BookToAnki.py" file.
